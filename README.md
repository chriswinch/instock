# In Stock ( https://instock.bike | WIP )

A directory to let you find bikes that are in stock right now.

Built with Remix, Puppeteer and Netlify.

TODO:
- [ ] Add pagination
- [ ] Filter by type & price
- [ ] Add select dropdowns to brand, price and type
- [ ] Add more content to homepage
- [ ] Add more bike shop scrapers, improve scraper code
- [ ] Get puppeteer running in lambda function on netlify or move scrapers to new service using node-cron in express.
- [ ] Try Playwright to solve the item above. I see Brian Vaughn had success here: https://github.com/bvaughn/planner/blob/main/pages/api/ogimage.js
